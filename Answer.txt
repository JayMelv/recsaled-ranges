To calculate the rescaled range of data using JavaScript, you can follow these steps:

Define your data: First, you'll need to define the data you want to analyze. You can store this data in an array.

Calculate the average: Calculate the average of the data by adding up all the values and dividing by the total number of values.

Calculate the deviations: Calculate the deviations of each value from the average. To do this, subtract the average from each value.

Calculate the cumulative sum: Calculate the cumulative sum of the deviations. To do this, add up the deviations of each value, starting from the first value.

Calculate the range: Calculate the range for each window size. To do this, subtract the minimum deviation from the maximum deviation for each window size.

Calculate the standard deviation: Calculate the standard deviation for each window size. To do this, calculate the square of the deviations, then sum them up and divide by the total number of values, and finally take the square root of the result.

Calculate the rescaled range: Calculate the rescaled range for each window size. To do this, divide the range by the standard deviation.

Plot the rescaled range: Plot the rescaled range against the window size.

Here's some sample code to get you started:
